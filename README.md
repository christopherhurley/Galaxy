Building intelligent recomendation engines utilizing named entity recognition 

## About

This project attempts to pick up on recomending movies based on their scripts and build automated questions to work out calculated possibilites that the user will choose one movie over the other by the storyline the script follows, this can include named places, locations and other various factors the user may not normally take into consideration when choosing a new movie. 

### Caveats

We expect the user to follow the below principles 

```
Watching a movie from start to finish
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
